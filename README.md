# Sample Bedrock Guardrails - Engineering Guide

## Overview 

This CloudFormation template deploys **13 specialized Bedrock Guardrails** for comprehensive AI security and compliance. Each guardrail targets specific threat vectors and use cases.

## How It Works

### **Architecture**
```
User Input → Bedrock Guardrail → Model Processing → Guardrail Output Filter → Response
```

### **Processing Flow**
1. **Input Filtering**: User prompts checked against word filters, topics, and regex patterns
2. **Content Analysis**: AI-generated responses evaluated for harmful content
3. **PII Protection**: Sensitive information detected and blocked/anonymized
4. **Response Delivery**: Clean, compliant responses returned to user

### **Conditional Deployment**
- Each guardrail can be deployed independently
- Use parameters to enable/disable specific use cases
- Supports multiple environments (dev/staging/production)

  --stack-name comprehensive-guardrails \
  --template-body file://comprehensive-python-guardrails.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=production
```

### **Deploy Specific Use Cases:**
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name security-guardrails \
  --template-body file://comprehensive-python-guardrails.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=DeployPromptInjectionGuardrail,ParameterValue=true \
               ParameterKey=DeployDataExfiltrationGuardrail,ParameterValue=true \
               ParameterKey=DeployCodeInjectionGuardrail,ParameterValue=true
```

### **Test Deployment:**

```

## Monitoring & Management

### **Check Guardrail Status:**
```bash
aws bedrock get-guardrail --guardrail-identifier GUARDRAIL_ID
```

### **Monitor Blocked Requests:**
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Bedrock \
  --metric-name GuardrailBlockedRequests \
  --dimensions Name=GuardrailId,Value=GUARDRAIL_ID \
  --start-time 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2024-01-02T00:00:00Z \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Sum
```

## Best Practices

### **Security Recommendations:**
1. **Start Restrictive**: Begin with strict settings, gradually relax
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate with real-world scenarios
3. **Monitor Continuously**: Track blocked vs allowed requests
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep patterns current with emerging threats

### **Performance Optimization:**
1. **Use Specific Guardrails**: Deploy only needed use cases
2. **Optimize Patterns**: Use efficient regex patterns
3. **Cache Results**: Leverage Bedrock's built-in caching
4. **Monitor Latency**: Track guardrail processing time

### **Compliance Considerations:**
1. **Document Decisions**: Log all guardrail configurations
2. **Regular Audits**: Review and update policies
3. **User Training**: Educate users on limitations
4. **Incident Response**: Plan for false positives/negatives

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
- **False Positives**: Legitimate requests blocked
- **False Negatives**: Malicious requests allowed
- **Performance Impact**: Increased response latency
- **Configuration Errors**: Invalid regex patterns
